## Responsive website for imaginary skate shop

The main objective of this project was to create a responsive website using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, with a previously prepared template.

Secondly, the goal was to develop a grasp of semantic HTML and CSS through the Sass 7-1 pattern.

### Design

Before starting this project, I prepared a graphic mock-up planning where specific elements would be located.

The most important things I took into account were:
- 📱 mobile and desktop screen display
- 🛹 characteristics of different skate designs
- ⭐ UX/UI principles
- 🎨 complementary color palette
- 💎 unique item reflecting the brand
- ⚖ balance between sections
- 👀 what the user will pay the most attention to

Below you can see the desktop version of the mock-up, both in black and white, as well as the color version with pictures. The final version of the deployed website is slightly different than the mock-up because of the decisions I made while coding.
